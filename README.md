# Retail_EDA_adhoc
I led a data integration and analysis project for a retail chain, connecting Snowflake to AWS for data extraction. Using SQL and Python, I integrated and cleaned data, performed EDA in Jupyter, and conducted ad-hoc analysis in Snowflake. This project optimized operations, empowered data-driven decisions, and enhanced efficiency.
